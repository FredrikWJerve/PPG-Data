# PPGData
This dataset consists of 1584 90s PPG measurements. Each recording have 4 columns representing raw adc values from 4 wavelengths (1:red,2:ir,3:blue,4:green). Each sample is labeled with the respective participant, level of pressure (1Max,2Med and 3Min) and position relative to the dorsalis pedis (-5-5mm). The values are negated to match the arterial blood pressure curve. Sample frequency is 800/s.Some recordings are noise filled or corrupted, especially for longer wavelengths at minimum pressure.
